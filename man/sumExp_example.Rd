\title{A `SummarizedExperiment` derived from our case study which builds on the dataset of Tasic et al. It contains the same cells 
as the data object used in the vignette (see `?Tasic_counts_vignette` for more information). In this SummarizedExperiment, we
performed a filtering with the `filterByExpr` of edgeR with more stringent than default parameter settings (min.count = 100,
min.total.count = 200, large.n = 50, min.prop = 0.9) to reduced the number of retained transcripts. We used this object to
create an executable example in the help files of satuRn.}
\format{
An object of class \code{SummarizedExperiment} with 1286 rows and 60 columns.
