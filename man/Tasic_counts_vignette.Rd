\title{A `Matrix` with transcript-level counts derived from our case study which builds on the dataset of Tasic et al. 
We used Salmon (V1.1.0) to quantify all L5IT cells (both for ALM and VISp tissue) from mice with a normal eye condition. 
From these cells, we randomly sampled 20 cells of each of the following cell types to use for this vignette;
L5_IT_VISp_Hsd11b1_Endou, L5_IT_ALM_Tmem163_Dmrtb1 and L5_IT_ALM_Tnc. The data has already been leniently filtered
with the `filterByExpr` function of edgeR.}
\format{
An object of class \code{matrix} (inherits from \code{array}) with 22273 rows and 60 columns.
